ASSIGNMENT 2

Due Date: 13 February 2020
Submission Date: 11 February 2020

Name: Shiva Keshav Govindaraju
SCUID: 00001588712

Notes:
- All Javadoc comments were generated by hand (I still have trouble figuring out how to get the IDE to do it automatically)
-- I was a little confused about whether or not we needed to make an html file of the Javadoc documentation, but as the
assignment document only asked for Javadoc comments, that's all I used in the commenting of my code. All necessary comments
for the generation of a Javadoc html file should be present within the src folder, however. If we were required to submit an html
documentation of our code, that was not made clear in the assignment document, and I suggest making that more explicitly clear in
future assignments.
- Sample output for EncryptionTester and ATM are given in Sample<insert-testing-class-here>Output.txt within the src folder.
- Be aware that EncryptionTester's Test-Set 2 is inherently random and any successive tests won't result in exactly the same output
as the sample given in the txt file. However, the Test Set 1 part of that should remain the same.
- Both main methods were tested with both within the IDE and through execution of the jar files via a terminal.
- Jar files were tested using: java -jar eclipse-workspace/COEN275_HW2/EncryptionTester.jar
-- Similarly with: java -jar eclipse-workspace/COEN275_HW2/ATM.jar
--- Given the way this is being submitted, the exact file-path to reach these jar files may be different for any tester,
and thus I remind the testers to substitute those file-paths with accurate filepaths to the jar files in their own testing
